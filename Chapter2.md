# Chapter 2 Learning Objectives:
By the end of the chapter, you will be able to:

- Differentiate between traditional programming paradigms and the machine learning paradigm
- Compare and contrast AI, ML, and Deep Learning
- Describe the three types of machine learning – supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning 
- Explain the process of training a typical machine learning system 
- Define features or attributes of data used in machine learning
- Define regression problems with examples
- Define classification problems with examples
- Explain the differences between regression and classification problems
- Describe what TensorFlow.js is
- Enumerate the advantages of performing machine learning using TensorFlow.js in JavaScript environments
- Explain the three ways of performing machine learning – using pre-made models, using transfer learning, and rolling out custom models

## AI vs. ML vs. Deep Learning
### AI
Definition: human intelligence exhibited by machines

Narrow AI: A system that can do one or maybe a few things as well or better than a human expert for that task

Examples of Narrow AI:
- text classification (automated forwarding based on message content)
- image classification (detecting cancer in images of brain tissue samples)
