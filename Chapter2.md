# Chapter 2 Learning Objectives:
By the end of the chapter, you will be able to:

- Differentiate between traditional programming paradigms and the machine learning paradigm
- Compare and contrast AI, ML, and Deep Learning
- Describe the three types of machine learning – supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning 
- Explain the process of training a typical machine learning system 
- Define features or attributes of data used in machine learning
- Define regression problems with examples
- Define classification problems with examples
- Explain the differences between regression and classification problems
- Describe what TensorFlow.js is
- Enumerate the advantages of performing machine learning using TensorFlow.js in JavaScript environments
- Explain the three ways of performing machine learning – using pre-made models, using transfer learning, and rolling out custom models

## AI vs. ML vs. Deep Learning
### AI
Definition: human intelligence exhibited by machines

Narrow AI: A system that can do one or maybe a few things as well or better than a human expert for that task

Examples of Narrow AI:
- text classification (automated forwarding based on message content)
- image classification (detecting cancer in images of brain tissue samples)

### ML
Definition: A program that runs and can learn from prior experience to find patterns in a given set of data. Can be retrained on a different dataset. 

Examples of Machine Learning:
- Object detection (where and how many of a thing are in an image whereas image detection detects the presence of something)
- Natural Language Processing (Spam detection; text content in emails are marked as spam from thousands of users and the model detects what is most likely to be spam; it is retrained every day; E.g.#2: Sentiment analysis of social media posts; Text Summarization; Language Translation)
- Linear Regression (a line of best fit to make a correlation between points of data on a graph; e.g. predicting house prices or stock prices)
- Audio Generation (turning your voice into a musical instrument; turning voice audio into human-readable text)
- Image Generation (Generating Human faces based on learned examples)

### Deep Learning
Uses Backpropagation to perform unsupervised learning. Contains multiple layers. 

### Compare & Contrast
Artificial Intelligence is the process of enabling human intelligence in systems. A subset of AI is Machine Learning. ML is an actual program that can learn from data. Deep Learning is a class of algorithm that can drive a machine learning program.
